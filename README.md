A [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) client implementation for [berightthere](https://github.com/mwvdev/berightthere).

This was a first attempt at using Flutter (and dart) but has been discontinued. It might be picked up when Flutter gets better plugin support for retrieving location updates from a background service.
